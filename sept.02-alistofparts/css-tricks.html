					<h2><a href="#">Prefetching, preloading,prebrowsing</a></h2>
					<p>When we talk about front end performance we think things like concatenation, minification, caching, or gzipping assets on the server so that the page loads faster and users can complete their goals as quickly as possible.

					Resource prefetching is another performance enhancing technique. We can use it to tell the browser which assets the user might need in the future—before they even need them.…

					<h2><a href="#">Gulp for Beginners</a> </h2>
					<p>The following is a guest post by <a href="#">Zell Liew.</a> I'm stoked to have Zell dishing out some Gulp 101. Zell has a comprehensive tutorial style (see his <a href="#">post on Susy</a>) that lends itself well to a topic of this scope. I've also <a href="#">tackled Grunt in a similar fashion</a>. I get the sense people found that pretty darn helpful, so here we go again with the equally popular Gulp!

					<h2> <a href="#">DIY Priority & Navigation</a></h2>
					<p>We've written a bit about the Priority+ pattern here before.<a href="#">Here's a bunch of real world examples.</a> I needed to use it recently. I found Gijs Rogé's <a href="#">priority-navigation.</a> It's pretty nice: no dependencies, clean code, fairly configurable and designable. It's not particularly small though, and there is a good amount of it defining helper functions. I was in an environment that had all that stuff available and so I figured I'd take a crack at a version. …

					<h2><a href="#">Six Tips for Chrome Dev Tools</a></h2>
					<p>The following is a guest post by Umar Hansa. Umar has a newsletter I'm a fan of and graciously offered to write this guest post in that style. I'll let him introduce himself.

					Hey, I'm Umar. I like to share web development related tips on Twitter (<a href="#">@umaar</a>) and also through <a href="#">Dev Tips</a> which is a newsletter of developer tips in the form of gifs. Right now, it's all primarily Chrome DevTools related. Before we get started, thank you …

					<h2> <a href="#">"probably doesn't do what you think it does"</a></h2>
					<p>An interesting post about the odd behaviour of querySelectorAll where it'll match elements that you might not expect at first glance:I think this API is surprising, and the front end engineers I've asked seem to agree with me. This is, however, not a bug; it's definitely how the spec claims it should work, and how it works in Firefox, Chrome and Safari.</p>

					<h2> <a href="#">#141: Getting the Images and Numbers for Responsive Images</a></h2>
					<p>You know about responsive images. It's about the image syntax in HTML. If you give it the right information in the right syntax, you can get the browser to download just exactly the right image it needs, without giving it too much or too little image data. It's fantastic for performance.

					You know that to get the most out of responsive images you should polyfill it with <a href="#">Picturefill</a>. You download it, you include it on your page.

					You have …
